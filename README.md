🚀 **From Zero to SwiftUI: My Coding Adventure at Apple Developer Academy!** ✨

An interactive iOS application showcasing personal profiles, built during my journey at Apple Developer Academy @ UC. This project transformed me from a SwiftUI beginner to someone who can confidently implement complex interactive interfaces.

## 📱 Overview

This app presents Livanty's personal profile through an engaging, interactive interface featuring dual personality aspects (Sports Enthusiast & Music Lover), achievements tracking, and immersive story experiences.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The app follows **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern with SwiftUI:
